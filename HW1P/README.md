# RIGHT ROAD, WRONG ROAD
## Right Road, Wrong Road is a game where each turn, the player has to choose whether to walk down the road on the left side or the road on the right side of a hill. The player has been chasing a Monsterthat will risk everything to eat some nice and tasty humans. By choosing the correct road, the player will be able to prevent the town at the end of that road from getting destroyed and its residents eaten. However, if the player chooses the wrong road, the player loses ‘one life’, and the demon eats everyone in the village down the other road. This cycle continuously repeats!
